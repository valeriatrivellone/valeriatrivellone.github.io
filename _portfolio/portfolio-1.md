## Project Overview

Phytoplasmas are obligate bacterial pathogens transmitted by insect vectors and infecting hundreds of plant species worldwide. Despite their global impact, large-scale patterns of host association remain poorly understood.

## Research Questions

- How structured are phytoplasma–host networks globally?
- Do host shifts follow phylogenetic constraints?
- How does biogeography influence network structure?

## Approach

We integrate global occurrence databases, natural areas global screening project in our lab, and ecological network modeling to quantify large-scale patterns of host association.

## Broader Impact

Understanding phytoplasma host associations improves prediction of pathogen emergence and informs agricultural management strategies.
