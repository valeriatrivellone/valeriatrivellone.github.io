## Project Overview

Phytoplasma diversity is shaped by evolutionary interactions with their plant hosts and insect vectors. A central question in host–parasite evolution is whether diversification arises primarily through repeated host switching or through long-term coevolutionary constraints.

This research theme investigates the evolutionary processes structuring phytoplasma–host associations across global lineages.

## Research Questions

 - Do phytoplasma–vector associations show phylogenetic congruence?
 - Are diversification patterns driven primarily by host switching?
 - Is host switching constrained by vector phylogeny?
 - What is the frequency and directionality of host-shift events?

## Approach

We integrate global phytoplasma sequence data with insect phylogenies to conduct cophylogenetic analyses. Using event-based and distance-based modeling approaches, we quantify congruence between phytoplasma and vector evolutionary histories.

## Broader Impact

Understanding the mechanisms underlying phytoplasma diversification improves our ability to anticipate evolutionary emergence, predict novel vector associations, and assess long-term pathogen adaptability under environmental change.
