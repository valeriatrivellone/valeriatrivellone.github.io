"...there are two factors: namely, the nature of the organism and the nature of
the conditions. The former seems to be much more the important; for nearly
similar variations sometimes arise under, as far as we can judge, dissimilar
conditions; and, on the other hand, dissimilar variations arise under conditions
which appear to be nearly uniform."
Darwin (1872: 32)

Short Bio
======
I am a Research Scientist in Vector Ecology at the Illinois Natural History Survey at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Chamapaign. My research focuses on the ecology and evolution of vector-borne plant pathogens, especially phytoplasmas. I combines ecological modeling, biodiversity data, and evolutionary frameworks to understand the emergence of new host–pathogen associations and to assess landscape-level disease risk. I created the global Hemiptera–Phytoplasma–Plant interaction database and an R package for modeling pathogen host switching. I currently leads an NSF-funded project on phytoplasma diversity and vector ecology in natural habitats. I have published more than 130 peer-reviewed papers.

Project Highlight
======
My lab investigates how parasitic microbes, particularly phytoplasmas, drive evolution. These bacteria manipulate the physiology and behavior of both plants and the insects that transmit them, a complex interaction that can lead to pathogens switching hosts and expanding their range. We use phytoplasmas as a model to understand the fundamental rules governing these associations, which have shaped species diversification for over 300 million years.

Our work extends beyond phytoplasmas—from biodiversity surveys to the quantitative ecology of biological associations. Keep reading to discover more about our diverse research activities.
