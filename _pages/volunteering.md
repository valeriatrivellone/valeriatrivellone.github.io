# Volunteering Opportunities

*Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS) Insect Collection & BioInteract Lab*

I offer hands-on volunteering opportunities for students interested in entomology, biodiversity science, and natural history collections. These experiences provide practical skills in insect curation and data management while contributing to long-term biodiversity research infrastructure.

# 1. Insect Pinning and Curation

**Students will learn:**

  - The art and technique of preserving and curating insect specimens
  - How to use a stereomicroscope to observe fine morphological traits
  - The extraordinary diversity of leafhoppers from around the world
  - Best practices in museum-quality specimen preparation

**Students will contribute to:**

  - Expanding and maintaining the insect biorepository at the Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS)
  - Preparing high-quality voucher specimens for long-term preservation
  - Supporting future taxonomic, morphological, and evolutionary research
  - Strengthening biodiversity infrastructure that serves scientists, students, and the public
  - This work ensures that physical specimens remain accessible for future generations of researchers.

# 2. Digitization of Voucher Specimens

**Students will learn:**

  - The basics of hierarchical biological classification
  - The principles of binomial nomenclature
  - How to manage biodiversity data using the INHS collection database
  - Standards for permanent digital archiving of specimen records

**Students will contribute to:**

  - Increasing the number of digitized specimens within the INHS insect collection
  - Enhancing accessibility of biodiversity records to the global scientific community
  - Supporting data integration with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)
  - Advancing open-access biodiversity science and large-scale ecological research
  - By digitizing specimens, students help make biodiversity data discoverable worldwide and contribute to global efforts in conservation, ecological modeling, and species distribution research.
